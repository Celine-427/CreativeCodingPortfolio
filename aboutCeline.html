    <h2 class="about-heading">Hello!</h2>
    <p class="crazy-paragraph">
      I’m Celine, a sophomore student at NYU’s IDM program. I love exploring new tech 
      tools and combining them with my passion for art and design. 
      My favorite color is pink, which you might have noticed from this website’s style!
    </p>
    <p class="crazy-paragraph">
      Outside of coding, I absolutely love dancing—I’ve been doing it since high school, 
      and it’s how I recharge my creativity. From hip-hop to contemporary, I like trying 
      different styles. I believe that music and movement spark new ideas, which helps me 
      come up with wild experiments in creative coding.
    </p>
    <p class="crazy-paragraph">
        I’m from Shanghai, a city full of life, history, and amazing street food. 
        I love wandering through busy neighborhoods, discovering hidden gems, 
        and enjoying the local culture. I have three adorable dogs that fill my
         home with energy and happiness. Some of my favorite activities include 
         exploring art galleries and meeting friends in cute coffee shops whenever 
         I have some free time.
    </p>

        If you’d like to know more about me, feel free to explore my other pages.
         I call this site the “Celine-code Universe” because it shows my love for bold colors,
          playful creativity, and a sense of fun. I hope you enjoy browsing my world and seeing what inspires me!
